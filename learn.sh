to switch to to text mode
you will have to type:

Every bash script can be executed
simply by typing
bash script.sh

./script.sh
you then have to give execution permissions
to the script with chmod:
chmod +x script.sh
means: add (+) execute (x) permissions to script.sh

which is $bash).
She-bang to use on this system:

Echo is one of the basic tools that are most commonly used in bash scripting: it prints out a message to the user. This very message is printed using echo.
The usage of this command is very simple: 

echo Words to print.

echo "If your phrase include newlines or special characters such as ', ;, :, &, !, and so on, you should enclose everything in quotes, like this:

echo \"This is something,
this is something else;

&@%# :)\"

echo "If your phrase also includes one of the following special characters, apart from being quoted they also have to be escaped using a backslash (\\):
\\\"
\\' if everything is enclosed in single quotes
\\\$ if followed by a letter or number
\\\`

Example:
echo This will print \\\"echo \\\` it works! \\\` \\\\ \\\"

Will print:
`echo This will print \\\"echo \\\` it works! \\\` \\\\ \\\"`
"
press
echo "To create a file using echo the usage is also very simple:
echo \"This and
this text will go to a text file.\" > file.txt

Of course, you can easily change the extension from txt to sh to create a shell script (just don't forget the shebang).

echo "The shell is a command interpreter.
More than just the insulating layer between
the operating system kernel and the user, it's also
a fairly powerful programming language.
A shell program, called aÂ  script, is an easy-to-use
tool for building applications by \"gluing together\"
system calls, tools, utilities, and compiled binaries.
Virtually the entire repertoire of UNIX commands,
utilities, and tools is available
for invocation by a shell script.
If that were not enough, internal shell commands,
such as testing and loop constructs,
lend additional power and flexibility to scripts.
Shell scripts are especially well suited for
administrative system tasks and other routine
repetitive tasks not requiring the bells and
whistles of a full-blown tightly structured
programming language."
